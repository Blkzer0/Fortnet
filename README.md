Raspberri pi for Meshnet connection
- Wifi adapter that supports broadcasting and connecting at the same time
- Battery pack (cant we just use the USB "charge your phone on the go" type things?)
- Solar chagers (again, cheap "charge your phone on the go" thing, plug its usb out to the battery pack)
- Case (some plastic bullshit)

# INTERMESH CONNECTIONS #

Server for P2P internet bridge
- Any computer running Debian (can change as needed)
- Could also be a Pi, they come with their own version of Debian installed already if you get the kit
- Needs a hard wire NIC to connect to your normal internet connection
- Needs wifi adapter that supports broadcasting to connect the Mesh end users.

City to City Inter-Mesh connection
